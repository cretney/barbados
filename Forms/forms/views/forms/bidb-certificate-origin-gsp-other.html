        <b>A. Procedure for claiming preference.</b> A declaration on the certificate of origin form must be prepared by the exporter of the goods and submitted in duplicate, together with a <b>{{ila.submission.origin}}</b> application form, to the certifying authority of the country of exportation which will, if satisfied, certify the top copy of the certificate of origin and return it to the exporter for transmission to the importer in the country of destination. The certifying authority will at the same time return to the exporter for his retention the duplicate copy of the certificate of origin, but will itself retain the <b>{{ila.submission.origin}}</b> application form duly completed and signed by the exporter.
